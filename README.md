## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and understanding various algorithms. Each algorithm implementation comes with detailed explanations, time complexity analysis, and practical examples.

## Categories

The algorithms are organized into the following categories:

- Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Data Structures
- String Algorithms
- Mathematical Algorithms

## Structure

Each algorithm is organized in its own directory with the following structure:

```
algorithm_name/
├── README.md         # Explanation and analysis
├── implementation/   # Implementation in different languages
└── examples/         # Example use cases
```

## How to Use

1. Browse to the category you're interested in
2. Read the algorithm's README for theoretical understanding
3. Check the implementation in your preferred programming language
4. Try out the examples to see the algorithm in action
