# Graph Algorithms

This section contains implementations and explanations of various graph algorithms.

## Available Algorithms

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
3. Dijkstra's Algorithm
4. Bellman-Ford Algorithm
5. Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
6. Kruskal's Algorithm
7. Prim's Algorithm
8. Topological Sort

## Structure

Each algorithm is organized in its own directory with the following structure:

```
algorithm_name/
├── README.md         # Explanation and analysis
├── implementation/   # Implementation in different languages
└── examples/         # Example use cases
```
